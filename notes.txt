// 6. Type in browser: 18.216.224.146:5000/?var=x where "x" is any value we want to send to the server

FOR PHOTORESISTOR:
If light is below shade value for several hours in a row during peak sunny hours, tell user to move plant

Analytics tasks:
1. Succulent should be between 40-50 humidity, cannot dip below this
2. Find max and min temp value a succulent should be in, display a warning if temp too high or low
3. Map the photoresistor min max values to display light as an interpretable percentage min = 0, max = 4095
4. If humidity drastically hikes, mark plant as watered and start countdown 
    * Make some formula that also makes watering sooner if humidity is very low

Web server:
Figure out how to display temp, moisture, light graphs, and current stats with tips/warnings
